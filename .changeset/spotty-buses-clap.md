Extensions can replace the file-navigation sidebar with their own React component via `hunk.registerSidebarView`. Extension files now receive Hunk's own React (and `@victor-software-house/hunk/extension` runtime values) when imported, so hooks and JSX work without bundling anything; the component gets live props (visible files with change types, selection, theme tokens) plus actions that drive review navigation exactly like the built-in sidebar, and a component that fails to render falls back to the built-in sidebar with a warning instead of taking down the session. The built-in sidebar is itself a bundled extension registered through this same API — the reference implementation a user-registered view overrides.
