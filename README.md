# hunk

Hunk is a review-first terminal diff viewer for agent-authored changesets, built on [OpenTUI](https://github.com/anomalyco/opentui) and [Pierre diffs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pierre/diffs).

## Install

```bash
npm i -g hunkdiff
```

Or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install hunk
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously installed hunk via `modem-dev/tap`, be sure to uninstall it first with `brew uninstall modem-dev/tap/hunk`.

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Git recommended for most workflows

> Nix users can use the `default` package exported in `flake.nix` instead. See [nix/README.md](./nix/README.md) for details.

## Quick start

```bash
hunk           # show help
hunk --version # print the installed version
```

### Working with Git

Hunk mirrors Git's diff-style commands, but opens the changeset in a review UI instead of plain text.

```bash
hunk diff                      # review current repo changes, including untracked files
hunk diff --watch              # auto-reload as the working tree changes
hunk show                      # review the latest commit
hunk show HEAD~1               # review an earlier commit
```

### Working with Jujutsu and Sapling

Hunk auto-detects Jujutsu and Sapling checkouts, so `hunk diff [revset]` and `hunk show [revset]` use native revsets inside jj or Sapling workspaces. To override VCS detection, set `vcs = "git"` or `vcs = "jj"` or `vcs = "sl"` in [config](#config).

### Working with raw files and patches

```bash
hunk diff before.ts after.ts                # compare two files directly
hunk diff before.ts after.ts --watch        # auto-reload when either file changes
git diff --no-color | hunk patch -          # review a patch from stdin
```

Watch mode remains continuous. Direct-file and Git-backed reviews normally use filesystem observation to refresh promptly, with periodic polling retained as a fallback for missed events or unavailable watchers. Jujutsu and Sapling reviews currently use polling rather than filesystem observation.

### Working with agents

1. Open Hunk in another terminal with `hunk diff` or `hunk show`.
2. Tell your agent to add the skill file returned by `hunk skill path`.
3. Ask your agent to use the skill against the live Hunk session.

A good generic prompt is:

```text
Load the Hunk skill and use it for this review. Run `hunk skill path` to get the skill path.
```

For the full live-session and `--agent-context` workflow guide, see [docs/agent-workflows.md](docs/agent-workflows.md). Experimental rich STML note bodies require starting the review with `--experimental`; plain agent notes remain the default.

Hunk is optimized for reviewing a full changeset interactively.

## Advanced

### Config

You can persist preferences to a config file:

- `~/.config/hunk/config.toml`
- `.hunk/config.toml`

Example:

```toml
theme = "github-dark-default" # any built-in theme id, auto, or custom
mode = "auto"        # auto, split, stack
vcs = "git"          # git, jj, sl
watch = false
exclude_untracked = false
line_numbers = true
tab_width = 4       # tab stops, 1-16
wrap_lines = false
menu_bar = true
agent_notes = false
prompt_save_view_preferences = true
transparent_background = false
```

Choose a built-in theme, `auto`, or a custom theme with `theme`. See
[docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md) for automatic selection, custom theme tables,
syntax scopes, and legacy syntax-table migration.

`exclude_untracked` affects Git/Sapling working-tree `hunk diff` sessions only.
`tab_width` controls source-code tab stops and can be overridden with `-x4` or `--tab-width 4`.
`prompt_save_view_preferences = false` disables the quit prompt for saving changed view preferences.
`transparent_background` can also be written as `transparentBackground`.

### Keybindings

Every keyboard shortcut is a named command, and a `[keybindings]` table in your
user config remaps command ids to the keys you want them on — several keys per
command, exclusive claims over defaults, and `false` to unbind. See
[docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md) for the rules, the chord grammar,
and the full table of built-in commands and their default keys.

### Git integration

Set Hunk as your Git pager so `git diff` and `git show` open in Hunk automatically:

> [!NOTE]
> Untracked files are auto-included only for Hunk's own `hunk diff` working-tree loader. If you open `git diff` through `hunk pager`, Git still decides the patch contents, so untracked files will not appear there.

```bash
git config --global core.pager "hunk pager"
```

Or in your Git config:

```ini
[core]
    pager = hunk pager
```

If you want to keep Git's default pager and add opt-in aliases instead:

```bash
git config --global alias.hdiff "-c core.pager=\"hunk pager\" diff"
git config --global alias.hshow "-c core.pager=\"hunk pager\" show"
```

### Jujutsu pager integration

To use Hunk as jj's pager, run `jj config edit --user` and update:

```toml
[ui]
pager = ["hunk", "pager"]
diff-formatter = ":git"
```

### Sapling pager integration

To use Hunk as Sapling's pager, run `sl config -u` and update:

```ini
[pager]
pager = hunk pager
```

### Extensions (experimental)

The extension API is experimental and may change in breaking ways between
minor releases while it stabilizes; breaking changes are called out in
release notes.

Hunk loads plain TypeScript extensions from `~/.config/hunk/extensions/`, from a
repository's `.hunk/extensions/` (after you explicitly trust that repository),
and from `--extension <path>` for development. `--no-extensions` turns those off
for one run; Hunk's own bundled backends (Git, Jujutsu, and Sapling) stay loaded.

A Phase 1 extension can contribute themes and file-extension → language
mappings, add a VCS backend, rewrite the changeset before review (collapse
lockfiles, reorder files by review priority), replace the file-navigation
sidebar with its own React component, react to lifecycle events, and show
transient messages:

```ts
// ~/.config/hunk/extensions/collapse-lockfiles.ts
import type { HunkExtensionAPI } from "hunkdiff/extension";

export default function (hunk: HunkExtensionAPI) {
  hunk.transformChangeset((changeset, ctx) => {
    const files = changeset.files.filter((file) => !file.path.endsWith(".lock"));
    ctx.notify(`Collapsed ${changeset.files.length - files.length} lockfiles`);
    return { ...changeset, files };
  });
}
```

See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) for the full API, the trust model,
and the `[extensions]` / `[extension.<id>]` config reference. Installable examples
include [review triage](examples/extensions/review-triage/) and an optional
[rendered Markdown file view](examples/extensions/rendered-markdown/).

### OpenTUI component

Hunk also publishes `HunkDiffView` and lower-level primitives from `hunkdiff/opentui` for embedding the same diff renderer in your own OpenTUI app.

See [docs/opentui-component.md](docs/opentui-component.md) for install, API, and runnable examples.

## Examples

Ready-to-run demo diffs live in [`examples/`](examples/README.md).

Each example includes the exact command to run from the repository root.
