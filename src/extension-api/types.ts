/**

 * slice of Hunk's internals — Pierre's diff types, the git/jj/sl backends —
 * into the package an extension author typechecks against. Keeping the contract
 * self-contained keeps the shipped `.d.ts` tree to this file and its barrel.
 *
 * Shapes internal code genuinely shares with extensions (agent sidecar records,
 * theme config tables) are declared here once and re-exported from their
 * internal homes, so there is still one definition per concept. Shapes that
 * cannot be shared because they reference the diff engine (`DiffFile`,
 * `VcsAdapter`) get a purpose-built public view here, narrow enough that the
 * host can accept it wherever it accepts the internal type.
