 * Key-chord parsing and matching for the command registry.
 *
 * The grammar itself lives in `src/extension-api/keys.ts` because extensions
 * need it too — it is published as part of `@victor-software-house/hunk/extension` — and is
 * re-exported here so internal code keeps importing key handling from one
 * place. What stays local is what extensions have no use for: synthesizing the
 * event a chord describes, which only conflict detection needs.
 *
 * A chord is the textual form a binding is declared in — `"s"`, `"G"`,
 * `"ctrl+r"`, `"f10"`, `"["` — used by built-in command defaults, extension
 * `registerCommand` calls, and the user's `[keybindings]` config table. A
 * command may still match with a predicate where one logical action cannot be
 * spelled as chords; chords and predicates meet at the dispatch table's `match`
 * shape so the dispatch loop treats them identically.
