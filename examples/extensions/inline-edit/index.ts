/**
 * Inline edit — a miniature line editor for the file under review.
 *
 * This is the demonstration three extension-API capabilities were built for,
 * and the proof that they compose:
 *
 * - `ctx.workspace` fills the buffer with `readDocument`, gates the affordance
 *   with `canWriteDocument`, and performs the consented `writeDocument`.
 * - a file view `mode` routes real keystrokes into the view: it claims arrows,
 *   most printable characters, Backspace, Enter, and Ctrl-S, and declines
 *   `]`, `?`, and `q` so navigation, help, and quit keep working. One
 *   `enterMode` selects the view *and* takes the keyboard, so one Ctrl-E opens
 *   the editor rather than two.
 * - `fileViews.refresh(VIEW_ID, { fileId })` re-derives the layout after every
 *   buffer or caret change, which is the only way a stateful view redraws at
 *   all — scoped to the edited file, because the buffer is that file's state
 *   and every other file presenting this view is still showing its document.
 *
 * Keys are matched with `matchesKey` from the public API rather than by reading
 * modifier flags, so Ctrl-S is recognized in both forms terminals send it:
 * `ctrl: true, name: "s"`, and the bare C0 control byte `0x13`, which
 * carries no `ctrl` flag at all.
 *
 * The load-bearing shape is the command handler. `onKey` must answer
 * synchronously, and the mode context deliberately carries only `file` and
 * `fileViews` — so a keystroke can only *request* a save. `ctx.workspace` is
 * valid for the whole life of a command handler's promise, so the handler that
 * entered the mode parks on a session lifecycle loop and is the thing that
 * actually writes. Every exit path — the reload after a save, Escape, a
 * host auto-exit — runs `onExit`, which ends that loop, so the handler always
 * settles and no promise is left dangling.
 *
 * That last guarantee is why the editor slot is claimed *synchronously*, before
 * the handler's first `await`: two fast Ctrl-E presses would otherwise both
 * pass a guard that only reads the live session, and the loser's loop would
 * park on a mailbox nothing is left holding a reference to.
