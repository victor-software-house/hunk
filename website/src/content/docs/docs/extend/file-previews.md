description: Add opt-in file presentations that keep Hunk's review navigation, scrolling, and inline notes.
---

`hunk.registerFileView(view)` lets an extension offer a different way to read a changed file. A Markdown extension can render headings and lists, a package extension can summarize dependency changes, and a CSS extension can put color swatches beside changed values.

A preview is still part of Hunk's normal review stream. Hunk keeps control of file ordering, measurement, scrolling, windowing, hunk navigation, selection, and inline notes. The extension describes deterministic rows; it does not replace the review pane.

The file-view API is experimental and requires extension API version 2.

## What users see

Raw diff is always the default. Installing an extension does not silently replace any files.

When a registered view matches the selected file, Hunk adds it under **View → File presentation**. The user can choose a presentation for each file independently, so one review may contain custom previews and ordinary Pierre diffs together.

After choosing a preview, **View → Apply “…” to all matching files** selects it for every matching file in the changeset, including files hidden by the current filter. Files that do not match keep their existing presentation.

An extension command can also select or toggle its view for the current file:

```ts
hunk.registerCommand({ id: "toggle-preview", title: "Toggle preview", key: "f8" }, (ctx) => {
  ctx.fileViews.toggle("preview");
});
```

`ctx.fileViews.select("preview")` selects a view, `select(null)` returns to raw diff, and `isActive("preview")` reports the current selection. A bare id names the calling extension's view; `"other-extension:preview"` addresses another registered view. These controls intentionally target only the current file; applying a view across the changeset remains a host-owned View-menu action.

`ctx.fileViews.refresh("preview")` invalidates that view's prepared layouts. Hunk treats `layout` as a pure derivation of `(file, width)` and reuses its result until one of those changes, so a view holding its own state — a fold, a toggled overlay — flips that state and then asks for the re-derivation. Refresh defaults to view-wide: every file presenting the view re-runs `matches` and `layout`, while files on raw diff or another view do no work. The rows already on screen stay visible until their replacement resolves, so a refresh never flashes back to raw diff. When the state that changed belongs to one file — a fold, a per-file edit buffer — pass `refresh("preview", { fileId })` so only that file re-lays out and the other presenting files keep their prepared rows. A `fileId` no reviewed file carries invalidates nothing.

## Register a view

A view has an id, a title, a cheap file matcher, and a layout function:

```ts
import type { HunkExtensionAPI } from "@victor-software-house/hunk/extension";

export default function (hunk: HunkExtensionAPI) {
  hunk.registerFileView({
    id: "preview",
    title: "Line preview",
    matches: (file) => file.path.endsWith(".md"),
    async layout(input) {
      const document = await input.readDocument("new");
      if (document === null || document === "") return null;

      const lines = (document.endsWith("\n") ? document.slice(0, -1) : document).split("\n");
      const hunkRows: Array<{ startRow: number; endRow: number }> = [];

      for (const hunk of input.file.hunks ?? []) {
        const [start, end] = hunk.newRange ?? [0, 0];
        // A missing or invalid new-side range cannot be positioned in this preview.
        if (start < 1 || end < start) return null;
        hunkRows.push({
          startRow: Math.min(lines.length - 1, start - 1),
          endRow: Math.min(lines.length - 1, end - 1),
        });
      }

      return {
        rows: lines.map((text, index) => ({
          id: `line:${index + 1}`,
          spans: [{ text: text || " " }],
        })),
        hunkRows,
      };
    },
  });
}
```

Return `null` whenever the view cannot safely present a file. Hunk will keep or restore the raw diff. This smallest example deliberately omits source bindings; add them only to rows owned by exactly one hunk extent, as described below.

### Matching

`matches(file)` decides whether the view appears in the View menu for that file. Keep it fast and side-effect free. Typical matchers use `file.path`, `file.changeType`, `file.isBinary`, or `file.isTooLarge`.

If `matches` throws, Hunk excludes the view for that file and keeps raw diff.

### Layout input

`layout(input)` receives one immutable snapshot:

| Field                | Meaning                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `file`               | The public file model, including path, change type, stats, patch text, and ordered hunk summaries. |
| `width`              | Available terminal columns. Return the same layout for the same input and width.                   |
| `signal`             | Aborts when a reload, resize, selection change, view change, or extension reload supersedes it.    |
| `changes`            | Typed added and removed source ranges with their hunk indexes.                                     |
| `readDocument(side)` | Lazily reads the exact `"old"` or `"new"` source document.                                         |

`readDocument` resolves to:

- a string for an available document;
- `""` for a valid empty document;
- `null` when the side does not exist, cannot be read, or exceeds host limits.

Cancellation aborts the pending request instead of producing a document value; use `input.signal` for any additional asynchronous work the layout starts. Patch text is available as `input.file.patch`, but a patch is not a complete source document. Use `readDocument` when parsing needs exact file contents. Reads are lazy and deduplicated within the request.

### Layout output

A layout contains `rows` and `hunkRows`.

Each row needs a stable `id` and a symbolic `spans` array. A span contains text plus an optional semantic tone and terminal attributes:

```ts
{
  id: "dependency:react",
  spans: [
    { text: "react", attributes: ["bold"] },
    { text: " 19.1.0 → 19.2.0", tone: "added" },
  ],
}
```

Tones are `muted`, `accent`, `accent-muted`, `syntax`, `added`, and `removed`. Attributes are `bold`, `italic`, `underline`, and `strikethrough`. Span text cannot contain newlines; create a separate row for each line. Hunk maps tones to the active theme while painting, so changing themes does not require a new layout.

`hunkRows` has one entry for every item in `input.file.hunks`, in the same order. Each entry is an inclusive, zero-based extent into `rows`. Hunk uses these extents for `[`/`]` navigation and selected-hunk highlighting even when several preview rows represent one source hunk.

## Keep inline notes attached to source

A row may declare the exact old/new source lines it presents:

```ts
{
  id: "rendered-paragraph:4",
  spans: [{ text: "A rendered paragraph" }],
  sourceRanges: [{ side: "new", range: [12, 15] }],
}
```

Source ranges are inclusive and one-based. Hunk verifies that they exist in the exact source document, do not overlap ranges owned by other rows on the same side, and belong to one hunk extent.

When agent notes are visible, Hunk uses these bindings to insert its own note cards before the matching preview row. The extension never receives note contents and never measures note UI.

Note placement is all-or-raw for each file. If any visible note has no unique bound row, Hunk temporarily shows the complete raw diff rather than hiding the note or guessing where it belongs. The selected preview returns when notes are hidden or all bindings become resolvable. Draft note editing also remains on raw diff.

Omit `sourceRanges` if the preview does not support inline-note placement. The preview still works whenever no visible note requires a binding.

## Paint a fixed-height JSX row

A row can replace its symbolic paint with a constrained React/OpenTUI component:

```tsx
{
  id: "package-summary",
  spans: [{ text: "Package changes", attributes: ["bold"] }],
  component: {
    height: 2,
    render: ({ width, height, selected, rowIndex, theme }) => (
      <box
        style={{
          width,
          height,
          backgroundColor: selected ? theme.selectedHunk : theme.panel,
        }}
      >
        <text content={`Package changes · row ${rowIndex}`} style={{ fg: theme.text }} />
      </box>
    ),
  },
}
```

The declared height is final. Hunk measures and windows the review before mounting components, then clips each component to its assigned rectangle. A component cannot grow the row, replace the scrollbox, or perform post-mount measurement that changes review geometry.

Painter props contain only fixed geometry, selected-hunk state, row position, and a live semantic `theme`. Theme changes repaint the component without rerunning `layout`.

Always provide useful `spans`. If the component throws, Hunk paints those spans inside the same fixed height. Components are non-focusable paint surfaces; registered commands are the supported keyboard path. Mouse delivery is cooperative, while wheel scrolling, dragging, and unhandled input remain host-owned.

React hook state is temporary paint state. It is lost when windowing unmounts the row, a width change creates a new layout, the user switches presentations, or the extension/session reloads. Keep durable extension state outside the row component.

## Interactive previews

Add a `mode` when a preview needs keyboard input:

```ts
mode: {
  onKey: (key, ctx) => {
    if (key.name === "space") {
      ctx.fileViews.refresh("preview");
      return "handled";
    }
    return "pass";
  },
},
```

Start it from a command with `ctx.fileViews.enterMode("preview")`. Entering also selects the preview and returns whether the mode started. Only one mode runs at a time; use `exitMode()` to stop it and `isModeActive("preview")` to check it.

`onKey` returns `"handled"` to consume a key, `"pass"` to continue normal Hunk routing, or `"exit"` to consume the key and stop. It must return synchronously. Escape is reserved by Hunk and always exits.

Modes also exit when their file, presentation, extension, or review session changes. Optional `onEnter` and `onExit` callbacks track that lifecycle; `onExit` runs exactly once per activation. A failing `onEnter` or `onKey` exits the mode, and any callback failure warns without breaking the review.

## Validation and fallback

Hunk validates every returned layout before using it. Current request limits are:

| Limit             |               Maximum |
| ----------------- | --------------------: |
| Rows              |                10,000 |
| Spans             |                40,000 |
| Source bindings   |                40,000 |
| Symbolic text     |  1,000,000 characters |
| One component row |     256 terminal rows |
| Complete layout   | 100,000 terminal rows |
| Layout request    |           1.5 seconds |

Layout work runs with bounded concurrency and cached results. Hunk discards layouts prepared for an old width, file snapshot, registration, or cancelled request.

A `null`, invalid, oversized, cancelled, timed-out, or throwing layout produces raw diff. A component failure affects only that row. Extensions are trusted code rather than a sandbox, but they should still treat fallback as a normal part of the contract.
