/**
 * Build a child-process env that overrides PATH cleanly on every platform.
 *
 * Windows environment variables are case-insensitive, but `{ ...process.env }`
 * preserves whatever case Bun reported (often `Path`). Setting `PATH: ...` on
 * top of that produces an env object with both `Path` (the original system
 * value) and `PATH` (the sanitized value); the child inherits both, and
 * Windows resolves lookups against the un-normalized union, defeating any
 * attempt to scope PATH. We strip every case-variant first, then set PATH.
